Machine Learning for Classification Using Weka

1. Project Overview
This project explores the performance of three machine learning algorithms—Naïve Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Decision Tree—in a classification task using the Speaker Accent Recognition Dataset. The study aims to compare these algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, while also analyzing the impact of hyperparameter tuning.

2. Tools & Technologies

 - Weka: Used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
 - Machine Learning Algorithms:
   * Naïve Bayes
   * Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
   * Decision Tree
   * Fold Cross-Validation: Applied to ensure reliable model evaluation.

3. Dataset
The Speaker Accent Recognition Dataset consists of 13 attributes, where feature X1 was chosen as the target class due to constraints in handling the language attribute.
