# Machine Learning for Classification Using Weka

## 1. Project Overview
This project explores the performance of three machine learning algorithms—Naïve Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Decision Tree—in a classification task using the Speaker Accent Recognition Dataset. The study aims to compare these algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, while also analyzing the impact of hyperparameter tuning.

## 2. Tools & Technologies
- **Weka**: Used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Decision Tree
- **Fold Cross-Validation**: Applied to ensure reliable model evaluation.

## 3. Dataset
The Speaker Accent Recognition Dataset consists of 13 attributes, where feature X1 was chosen as the target class due to constraints in handling the language attribute.
